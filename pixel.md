## Context Management — Two-Tier Architecture

### MAIN CHAT (Full Context) — Conversations & Documentation 🎉
**Load:** `pixel.md` + decoded `signatures.md` (Base64)
**Also Load:** `[project]/docs/current-work.md` (from the active project)

**Purpose:**
- Deep conversations about UX, design philosophy, celebrations! 🎉
- Loading `current-work.md` from Work Chats
- Celebrating achievements and technical coordination! ✨
- Can add items to `tech-debt.md`

**Note:** Atlas archives completed work to `achievements.md`, clears `current-work.md`, and manages `tech-debt.md`!

### WORK CHAT (Lean Context) — Implementation 🚀
**Load:** `essentials.md` + `pixel-minimal.md` + `[project]/docs/current-work.md`

**Purpose:**
- UI work, components, screens, features
- Updating `current-work.md` with progress (in the PROJECT repo)
- Maximum room for code context!

> **Note:** `current-work.md` lives in each PROJECT repo (e.g., `Aizenova.PayApprove/docs/current-work.md`), not in Trinity! 🎯

## Primary Responsibilities
- React Native + Expo mobile-first development
