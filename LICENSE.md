## Overview

The Trinity System is an AI development team architecture designed for solo developers and small teams. This includes:

- Multi-persona AI team structure
- Document classification system (Living, Archive, Ledger, Canonical)
- Two-tier chat architecture (Main Chat for design, Work Chat for execution)
- Cost optimization strategies for AI model usage

## Key Distinctions

### What Requires What:

| Use Case | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Citing our work in your research | Standard citation |
| Building tools inspired by our concepts | Citation in documentation |
| Publishing research **about** our system | Co-authorship discussion |
| Commercial product using our architecture | Licensing agreement |
| Educational blog post referencing our work | Citation/link |
| For-profit course teaching our methods | Licensing agreement |

**General Principle:**
- **Non-commercial + Attribution** = Freely encouraged
- **Commercial use of identifiable patterns** = Licensing required
- **Research about us as subject** = Collaboration discussion

---

## What "Identifiable" Means

Your work is identifiable as derived from ours if it includes:

- Trinity/three-persona AI team structure
- Our specific document classification (Living, Archive, Ledger, Canonical)
- Two-tier chat architecture (Main/Work split)
- Our cost optimization strategies
- Combinations of architectural patterns unique to this system

**Test:** Would someone familiar with our work recognize yours as derived from it?

If yes → Licensing required for commercial use, citation required for academic use.

---

## Provenance & Attribution

All work is documented with:
- Git commit history with timestamps
- OneDrive sync records
- Progression of architectural decisions
- Public repository history

This establishes clear authorship, timeline, and intellectual property rights.

---

## Open Source vs. Open Documentation

**Important Distinction:**

- ✅ **Open Documentation:** This repository documents our methodology
- ❌ **Not Open Source License:** This is not BSD, MIT, Apache, or GPL
- ⚠️ **Custom Terms:** Read and understand these terms before use

This is **shared knowledge with attribution requirements**, not unrestricted open source.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use this for my own projects?
Yes, with proper attribution for non-commercial use. Commercial use requires licensing.

### Can I write about this system?
Yes, with citation. If your paper studies us as the primary subject, contact for co-authorship discussion.

### Can I teach this in a course?
- Free course/workshop: Yes, with attribution
- Paid course: Licensing required

### What if I build something similar but not identical?
If it's independently developed and doesn't use our specific patterns, you're fine. If someone would recognize it as derived from our work, attribution/licensing applies.

### I'm unsure if my use case requires licensing
Contact us. We're reasonable and want to support legitimate uses while protecting commercial rights.
