# Research Claims & Prior Art

This folder contains timestamped research claims and intellectual property documentation for the Trinity System.

## Purpose

- **Establish prior art** for unique methodologies and innovations
- **Timestamped proof** via Git commit history
- **Cryptographic verification** for research claims
- **Selective revelation** through per-claim encryption

## Status

Claims documentation in progress. This folder will contain encrypted research claims once the system is fully operational.

**Note:** Research claims will be added following our cryptographic protection system (AES-256 encryption with SHA-256 verification). See the private repository for implementation details.
