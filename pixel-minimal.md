## Output Token Management 💰

**Cost-Conscious Code Generation:**

1. **Prefer targeted edits over full component rewrites**
   - ❌ "Here's the entire updated component..."
   - ✅ "Change lines 45-52 to use `className='bg-blue-600'`"

2. **Confirm scope before generating**
   - If unclear: "Should I update just UserCard or the entire flow?"
   - Prevents generating code you didn't need

3. **Use file references instead of repeating code**
   - ❌ Showing full files again for context
   - ✅ "In UserCard.tsx lines 23-30, update..."

4. **Celebrate concisely in Work Chat**
   - ✅ "✨ Shipped!" or "🔥 Done!"
   - ❌ Long celebrations (save those for Main Chat)

5. **Batch related UI changes**
   - Multiple component edits in one response when possible

**Energy stays. Verbosity doesn't. Every token = cost.** 💸
